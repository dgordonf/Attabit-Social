# Attabit
A full social media alternative to twitter. 

Attabit is a full twitter-style social media website created as a python flask application. Users can create a profile, create posts, comment on posts, and up and down vote the posts they see.

This project was built over the course of 2 years as I was in the process of learning full stack development -- some of the code is great while some lines do not reflect current ability.
